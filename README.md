This was done as part of the coursework for CZ3005: Artificial Intelligence 

In this assignment, we were given a problem of finding a shortest traverse path between two locations within a certain energy budget. This scenario often happens in the transportation where a shorter path is not necessarily more energy efficient (e.g., the road may be very bumpy or has heavy traffic)
 
The following search methods were implemented:
 
 * Uniform Cost Search
 * A* Search

You can check out the report for more information on how these algorithms were implemented.
